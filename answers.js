// Methods, Revisited

/* Here is a list of favMovies:

Do the following and console.log the final results 
(I have included some thought questions, you don't have to write out an answer for those marked as such):
Note: if you have to add to the array, feel free to add any movie you'd like

use the .sortmethod Thought question: what did this do to the array? Did it permanently alter it?
Use the method pop
push"Guardians of the Galaxy"
Reverse the array
Use the shiftmethod
unshift- what does it return?
splice"Django Unchained" and add "Avatar" (try finding the index of "Django Unchained", instead of counting it yourself) Thought question: did this permanently alter our array?
slicethe last half of the array (challenge yourself and try to programatically determine the middle of the array rather than counting it and hard coding it) - Thought question: did this permanently alter our array?
store the value of your slicein a variable, console.log it - Thought question: what is going on here?
console.log your final results
After running the above tasks, console.log the index of "Fast and Furious" -We removed it from the array, what value do we get when we look for the index of something that is not in the array?
Thought question: that we declared the variable favMovieswith const, and yet, we were allowed to change the array. Weird? Should we have used let?

Return of the Closets
Below, we've given you examples of Kristyn and Thom's closets modeled as data in JavaScript. Use this data to answer the following questions.

const kristynsCloset = [
  "left shoe",
  "cowboy boots",
  "right sock",
  "Per Scholas hoodie",
  "green pants",
  "yellow knit hat",
  "marshmallow peeps"
];

// Thom's closet is more complicated. Check out this nested data structure!!
const thomsCloset = [
  [
    // These are Thom's shirts
    "grey button-up",
    "dark grey button-up",
    "light blue button-up",
    "blue button-up",

    "PJs"
  ],[
    // Thom's accessories
    "wool mittens",
    "wool scarf",
    "raybans"
  ]
];
Alien Attire
Kristyn's left shoe has traveled through time and space and turned up in Thom's accessories drawer! Remove Kristyn's shoe from the array and save it to the variable kristynsShoe. Use that variable to add Kristyn's lost shoe to Thom's accessories array.
Dress Us Up
Modify your code to put together 3 separate outfits for Kristyn and Thom. Put the output in a sentence to tell us what we'll be wearing. Mix and match!
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Kristyn and Thom have their outfits ready for class - array practice"
Dirty Laundry
Continue looking at the closet arrays:

Time to do laundry - loop through Kristyn's closet and log the sentence "WHIRR: Now washing (item)" for each item in the array.
Inventory
Thom wants to do inventory on his closet. Using bracket notation, log the arrays containing all of Thom's shirts, pants, and accessories.
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Hungry for More: I tackled..."
Technical Requirements
A JavaScript file that runs without syntax errors (comment out stuff that doesn't work)
At least one commit message per problem
